        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We wanted to create this wiki to share the tips, tricks, and workflows we have developed through Cities: Skylines I and now into Cities: Skylines II. Outside of a few points in the official wiki, Cities: Skylines I map making information was difficult to find, and applying general QGIS methods to our specific needs required lots of trial and error.</p>
<p>We hope that this wiki will be a consolidated resource for information about map making that compliments official information made available by Colossal Order and how to apply QGIS/GIS methods towards the specific goal of creating maps for Cities: Skylines II.</p>
<p>Thanks for visting, we hope you've found this site helpful!</p>]]></content>
